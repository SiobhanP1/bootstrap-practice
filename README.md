# Whiskey Subscription Website

## Purpose

This website was built as a way to practice implementing some basic Bootstrap features. 
The site currently exists purely as a static site with HTML and CSS files. 

### Goals

The external user goal is to access information about a whiskey tasting subscription service and to be able to subscribe to that service via the website. (Interactivity, log-in, log-out, etc. has not yet been added to the website.)

The internal user goal is to display key information about a whiskey tasting subscription service, the means to edit such information and the means to view and manage subscriber information.

## Credits

Project design and the features on the home page match those of the Code Institute Bootstrap Walkthrough project.
